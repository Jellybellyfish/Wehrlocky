I like to think of myself as a real disk jocky. I enjoy music in it's many various forms and like to read about new technolgies that innovative peoples are working together to create. For me personally there are a lot of things that could fit into the shell of being musical while not necessarilly being a melodic song. I really like exploring all the different ways to have a musical experience.
